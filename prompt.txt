MGMT.golf Web App

Your task is to build my web app using the Wasp OpenSaaS framework (already in the project) with existing integrations (Stripe payments, Prisma DB, email notifications). Refer to Waspâ€™s OpenSaaS docs (in opensaas.txt) before development. I already have the Wasp Opensaas.sh starter app running at localhost:3000
